# E-Commerce Customer and Sales Analysis

This analysis draws insights from an e-commerce database by performing SQL queries through Python and visualizing the results using charts. Below are the key findings and their implications:

Cities Covered: The platform has customers from a wide variety of cities across the country (exact number not shown, but extracted via DISTINCT).

Top States by Customer Count:

States with the highest customer concentrations were highlighted.

A bar chart displays customer distribution by state, with top states contributing a significantly larger share.

Sales by Product Category:

Total sales were aggregated and ranked by product category.

Categories such as Electronics, Furniture, and Fashion showed significant revenue.

Installment Payments:

~49.8% of the total orders were paid using installment methods.

Indicates a strong preference for flexible payment solutions.

Installment Strategy: Given the high percentage of installment-based purchases, offering promotions with 0% EMI options could further drive sales.

Geo-Marketing: Focus marketing and logistics resources on states with high customer density.

Seasonal Planning: Plan inventory and campaigns ahead of months with historically high order volumes (e.g., festive seasons).

Category Expansion: Categories with high revenue should be analyzed deeper for potential upselling and cross-selling.
